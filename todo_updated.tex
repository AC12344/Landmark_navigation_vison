 - Issues with connecting to drone 
 
Next steps:
 - Connect to drone - done
 - hover irl - not quite working yet - drifting 
 - Outside test 
 - Vision test - shut off motors and test the three/four colours 
 - Check the waypoint - with motor spin test. 
 - tuen the stability 
 - data logging - drifting, inputs, outputs, visual - graphs. 
 - colour-based navigation irl using waypoints
