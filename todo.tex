1) Get the the ship running with multiple waypoints - including going back on the x-axis. 
2) Port that to the drone - try fly the way points on the drone
3) Potentially need to adjust the PID for XY-pos 
4) Find a way to insert a marker into the simulation - not that important
5) Vision - regonise the marker, add the new waypoint to the list - focus more
6) Genereal tuning of everything. 



list of goals: 
1) Achieve the drone can follow a track of markers - uses the orientation of the marker/or use information encoded into the marker to know its new orientation.  
2) Achieve encoding information in visual markers/visual communication with  the drone.
3) E-book reader for wasy way to change the markers 
4) Test the general robustness of the system by testing inside and outside. 
5) General understanding of GNC 


More time: 
Marker - height information - either on this marker or from this to the new marker.
marker that encodes the landing point - or maybe the end point (then it has to return and backtrack its route)  

keep it simple, stupid
test each part individually on the drone
