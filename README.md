# Landmark_navigation_vison
Landmark based navigation using vision for GNC SDU miniproject 2021.  GNC algorithm made in matlab and c and ported to the parrot mini drone.
 
How to:
Running the Simulation:
1) For running the simulation, open the project folder "asbQuadcopter4" and run the simulink file.
2) The file "controller.m" also needs to be run, as this calcualtes the LQI gains.
3) Run the simulation.

Running the code that can be generated and ported to the drone:
1) Open the project called hover_tuning_project and open the Simulink file of the same name.
2) FOllow step 1) and 2) of the simulation guide
3) connect to the drone
4) generate the code.
